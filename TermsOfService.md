## Basic information for the user
Please note that some provisions of these Terms may only apply to certain categories of Users. In particular, some provisions may apply only to `SCP 00-Ω's Community staffers` or to those Users who qualify as belonging to the server [`SCP 00-Ω's Community`](https://discord.gg/HCkYcSBHu8). Such limitations are always explicitly mentioned within each affected clause. In the absence of such mention, the clauses apply to all Users. Use of `SCP 00-Ω` and the Service is age-restricted, as specified in the relevant section of this document.

## Terms of use
Unless otherwise noted, the terms of use described in this section generally apply when using `SCP 00-Ω`.

Single or additional terms of use or access may apply in specific scenarios and in such cases are further indicated herein.

By using `SCP 00-Ω`, Users confirm that they meet the following requirements:

## Content on `SCP 00-Ω`
Unless otherwise specified or clearly recognizable, all content available on `SCP 00-Ω` is owned or provided by the `Owner` or its licensors.

The `Owner` makes every effort to ensure that the content provided on `SCP 00-Ω` does not violate applicable legal provisions or third party rights. However, it may not always be possible to achieve such a result.
In such cases, without prejudice to any legal prerogatives of Users to assert their rights, Users are invited to preferably report the related complaints using the contact details provided in this document.

## Content rights to/of `SCP 00-Ω`
The `Owner` owns and reserves all intellectual property rights for such content.

Users cannot therefore use such contents in any way that is not necessary or implicit in the correct use of the Service.

In particular, but without limitation, Users may not copy, download, share (beyond the limits indicated below), translate, transform, publish, transmit, sell, sublicense, modify, transfer/assign to third parties or create derivative works of the content available on `SCP 00-Ω`, nor allow third parties to do so through the User or his device, even without the User's knowledge.

Any applicable legal limitations or copyright exceptions will remain unaffected.

## Access to external resources
Through `SCP 00-Ω` Users can have access to external resources provided by third parties. Users acknowledge and accept that the `Owner` has no control over these resources and is therefore not responsible for their content and availability.

The terms and conditions applicable to any resource provided by a third party, including those applicable to any granting of rights in the content, derive from the terms and conditions of each such third party or, in the absence thereof, from the applicable legal law.

In particular, on `SCP 00-Ω` Users may view advertisements provided by third parties. The `Owner` does not monitor or moderate the advertisements displayed through `SCP 00-Ω`. If users click on such advertisements, they will interact with any third party responsible for that advertisement.

The `Owner` is not responsible for any issues arising from such interaction with third parties, such as anything resulting from visiting third-party websites or using third-party content.

Users are solely responsible for ensuring that their use of `SCP 00-Ω` and/or the Service does not violate any applicable law, regulation or third party right.

Therefore, the `Owner` reserves the right to take any appropriate measure to protect its legitimate interests including denying Users access to `SCP 00-Ω` or the Service, terminating contracts, reporting any unlawful actions carried out through `SCP 00-Ω` or the Service to competent authorities - such as judicial or administrative authorities - whenever it is suspected that Users are violating laws, regulations, third party rights and/or these Terms, including, but not limited to, by engaging in any of the following activities:
